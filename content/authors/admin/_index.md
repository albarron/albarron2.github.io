#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

THIS WEBSITE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION (LAST MODIFICATION: 25/06/24)

I am Associate Professor at [Universit√† di Bologna](https://dit.unibo.it) since 
2022 (after three years as Senior assistant professor; RTDb, in the Italian 
system). I have been working on the (cross-language) assessment of 
text looking at different aspects such as originality (e.g., plagiarism 
detection) and intent (e.g., propaganda, hate speech).

Visit my [UniBO website](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/a.barron) for university 
matters.

Before landing at [UniBO](https://dit.unibo.it), I spent 5 years as a Scientist 
at the Language Technologies group of [QCRI](http://www.qcri.org) and 2 as 
research fellow at 
[TALP](http://www.talp.upc.edu/).
