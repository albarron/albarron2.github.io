summary: Inivted Webinar for the Spanish AI Tech Talks.
abstract: 'The Internet is plagued with contents that go from hate speech to disinformation, from propagaganda to scam, to mention just some of them. In this seminar I talk about some of our efforts to spot some of them, under the main premise that, if they turn evident, their effect on the user get dimmed. The talk will start talking about the identification of propaganda in text (news, tweets, email) and will head towards the identification of hate speech both in text and memes.'
