summary: Invited talk for the QMUL Cognitive Science Seminar Series 
abstract: Posting contents online is at everybodyâ€™s fingertips. As a result any person can easily distribute information to pursue an agenda. Still, even "formal" newspapers have an agenda and use propaganda to convey it. Whereas propaganda does not necessarily involve lying, it is a common resource employed to spread a message and influence in the people's perception of the current affairs. In this talk, I will discuss the problem of propaganda identification in text. The objective of such task is dimming the effect of propaganda by warning the lay user about a text that aims at influencing her. I will discuss on the inception of this research problem, some of the latest technology approaching it, and potential future research avenues, which aim to target multiple languages and scenarios.
