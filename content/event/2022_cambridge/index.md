summary: Invited talk for the U. of Cambridge NLP seminars series.
abstract: 'The web is packed with harming contents ranging from hate speech and fake news to propaganda and scams, to mention a few examples. In this talk, I will offer an overview of our efforts against some of them, under the premise that, by making them evident, their effect gets dimmed. The talk will depart at the identification of propaganda in text and will travel towards the identification of hate speech in both text and memes. I will close with some spoilers about our early works on identifying propaganda in both hate speech and spam email.
