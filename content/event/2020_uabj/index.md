summary: Invited talk about the introduction of computing science into a translation department.
abstract: 'Even if conceived in the intersection of linguistics and computing science, natural language processing (NLP) has turned into a more computational than a linguistic field. Whereas computing science curricula often include NLP, linguistics and translation curricula usually do not. In many cases, software is perceived as an out-of-the box tool. In this seminar, I discuss the ongoing integration of computing scientists in a translation and interpreting department. I will overview the contents of the computational linguistics course, as well as some of the students research so far: 
  (i) emotion identification in lyrics, (ii) a stylistic study of theatre characters in English and Italian, and (iii) misogyny and aggressiveness identification in tweets. I will close with a punctual overview of research on other topics, such as propaganda identification and the use of cognates to make texts in foreign languages understandable.'
