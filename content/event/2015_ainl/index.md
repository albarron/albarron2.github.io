abstract: 'Text re-use is “the situation in which pre-existing written material is consciously used again during the creation of a new text or version” (Clough, 2010). Plagiarism, the most (in)famous kind of text re-use, occurs when no credit is given to the author of an original ---borrowed--- material. In this talk I discuss four main topics: (i) the 3-axes strategy to discourage plagiarism in academia: prevention, surveillance, and response; (ii) the different mechanisms applied when borrowing a text, ranging from verbatim copy to translation; (iii) the computational models available to uncover (or not!) different types of borrowings; and (iv) a couple of scenarios in which text re-use (and its detection) is actually beneficial.'
