abstract: 'Misogyny is often expressed through figurative language. Some neutral words
  can assume a negative connotation when functioning as pejorative epithets. Disambiguating
  the meaning of such terms might help the detection of misogyny. In order to address
  such task, we present PejorativITy, a novel corpus of 1,200 manually annotated Italian
  tweets for pejorative language at the word level and misogyny at the sentence level.
  We evaluate the impact of injecting information about disambiguated words into a
  model targeting misogyny detection. In particular, we explore two different approaches
  for injection: concatenation of pejorative information and substitution of ambiguous
  words with univocal terms. Our experimental results, both on our corpus and on two
  popular benchmarks on Italian tweets, show that both approaches lead to a major
  classification improvement, indicating that word sense disambiguation is a promising
  preliminary step for misogyny detection. Furthermore, we investigate LLMs′ understanding
  of pejorative epithets by means of contextual word embeddings analysis and prompting.'
